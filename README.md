We have used a simple Flutter mobile application project called Morsey which can encode and decode Morse code to English and vice versa. 

This application has been built using the DevOps methodology with the help of Codemagic for continuous integration and continuous deployment.


## What is CodeMagic?

Codemagic is a CI/CD tool mainly focusing on the integration and deployment of mobile applications be it Flutter, React-native or iOS. 

With the help of Codemagic, you can build, test, and publish Flutter apps with zero configuration and run builds in controlled environments using custom workflows
